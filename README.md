EpochDivider
============

Time management system inspired by SCRUM and GTD techniques. See my website for more information on this experiment at [http://www.cdahmedeh.net/epoch-divider/](http://www.cdahmedeh.net/epoch-divider/).

A Desktop application (Swing) and Android application were planned.

To start playing with the Epoch Divider source code, import all the Proj_OrganizerApp_Vers5_* folders as projects in Eclipse. Then run "MainWindow.java" as a Java Application.

The other Vers[0-4] folders are older versions just for historical reference.

Have fun!
